Greetings! I'm Dale Lim - a software engineer who enjoys sleeping for more than 8 hours and eating past midnight.

Welcome to my misguided attempt at writing a blog. This beautiful corner of the web will mostly serve as a journal for experiments/coding stuff that I have done through the years. It is here where I will be documenting my works and blunders, and anything in between . Probably some personal/non coding related stuff too if I feel like it.

Hope you enjoy and learn something!

While you're here, check out some of my stuff!<br>
