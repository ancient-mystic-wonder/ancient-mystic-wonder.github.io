One thing has always been on by bucket list, and has always interested me for most of my life as a developer, is creating my own personal custom rom for Android. Now, I am aware that this is a rather challenging undertaking which will span months, maybe even years (since this is something I will have to do outside of work), however that will not deter me. This series will document all my experiments, learnings, and side-quests on anything rom-dev related (such as porting, rooting, custom kernels, etc.) which will ultimately help me in developing the DaleOSP - my own custom rom.

As of writing this article, I have only began to scratch the surface of the deep iceburg that is rom development. In fact, nowadays my free time mostly consists of browsing and reading a ton of posts on XDA and the Cyanogenmod archives (and some Tekken). Hence making this post officially Part 0.

## What's in this post?

Being a developer who is still taking his first baby steps in rom dev, I have decided to get a feel of the build process by building the stock Marshmallow AOSP rom for a Nexus 5 device (yes, Android is already at Oreo and P preview as of March 3, 2018, but I chose the Nexus 5 because it is the only phone that I have a chance of getting with my tight budget). The process should be relatively the same for the later versions.
